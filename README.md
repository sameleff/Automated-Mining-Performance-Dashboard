# Automated Mining Performance Dashboard
The Automated Mining Performance Dashboard tool can be used to store and display real-time performance and status information for multiple popular cryptocurrency miners, mining pools, and mining software. The dashboard is accessible from any device (even non-local to the mining operation) via a personal URL.

The program is written in Python and requires an Anvil account in order to utilize the dashboarding features.

# Features:
*	Automated real-time mining performance tracking
*	Web-based dashboarding
*	Real-time mining status alerts
*	Ability to track multiple coins, pools, and mining software
*	Automatic cryptocurrency price trending

# Accessible Data:
This program can currently access data from the following sources:
| Mining Pool / API | Coin |
| ----------------- | ---- |
| Ethermine	| Ethereum (ETH)|
| Nanopool	| Ethereum (ETH)|
|	Nanopool	| Ergo (ERG)|
| MoneroOcean	| Monero (XMR)|
| SpacePool	| Chia (XCH)|
| Helium Explorer	| Helium (HNT)|
| AlgoExplorer	| PlanetWatch (PLANETS)|

Although multiple options for GPU mining software are available, this program is currently only able to access the status information for NBMiner. Future updates plan to enable access to other major GPU mining software (such as T-Rex, Nanominer, etc.).
